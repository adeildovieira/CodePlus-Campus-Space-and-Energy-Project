## Overview

This project was developed in collaboration with Duke Campus Facilities Team to address Duke University's climate commitment of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. Our goal was to create a solution to track building occupancy for improved space and energy management.

## My Contributions

I worked in a full-stack environment with responsibilities spanning backend, database integration, and front-end data display:

- **Backend Development:**
  - Developed Python scripts to perform random forest and linear regression analyses on CO₂ data.
  - Created code for the Raspberry Pi to interface with the CO₂ sensor.
  - Implemented real-time data transfer from the sensor to our PostgreSQL database.
  
- **Database & Front-End Integration:**
  - Wrote SQL queries to synchronize CO₂ data with front-end widgets.
  - Collaborated on the website development using HTML, React, and CSS.

## Project Timeline & Description

**Timeline:** May 20th – July 31st

The project was divided into two phases:
1. **Initial Phase (First 3 Weeks):** Collaborative work on processing Wi-Fi data.
2. **Division of Tasks:** Focus shifted to backend development where I concentrated on:
   - Modeling CO₂ data with Python.
   - Integrating and managing sensor data via Raspberry Pi.
   - Polling, saving, and sorting data.
   - Deploying data using a REST web service (FastAPI) to our database.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Python (Pandas, GeoPandas)
  - Voila widgets
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL
  - Data Sources: Wi-Fi (Splunk) and CO₂ sensor data (Raspberry Pi, ATLAS™ Sensor)
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Workflow & Deployment:**
  - Git (CI/CD)
  - Docker & Docker Compose  
  - Branches: `main`, `development`, and `production`
